Print Anagrams Together 
Medium Accuracy: 56.1% Submissions: 23997 Points: 4
Given an array of strings, return all groups of strings that are anagrams. 
The groups must be created in order of their appearance in the original array. Look at the sample case for clarification.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
words[] = {act,god,cat,dog,tac}
Output: 
god dog
act cat tac
Explanation:
There are 2 groups of
anagrams "god", "dog" make group 1.
"act", "cat", "tac" make group 2.

2.
Overlapping rectangles 
Easy Accuracy: 33.51% Submissions: 6970 Points: 2
Given two rectangles, find if the given two rectangles overlap or not. 
A rectangle is denoted by providing the x and y coordinates of two points: the left top corner and the right bottom corner of the rectangle. 
Two rectangles sharing a side are considered overlapping. 
(L1 and R1 are the extreme points of the first rectangle and L2 and R2 are the extreme points of the second rectangle).

Note: It may be assumed that the rectangles are parallel to the coordinate axis.

rectanglesOverlap

Example 1:

Input:
L1=(0,10)
R1=(10,0)
L2=(5,5)
R2=(15,0)
Output:
1
Explanation:
The rectangles overlap.

3.
Count the subarrays having product less than k 
Hard Accuracy: 56.01% Submissions: 5376 Points: 8
Given an array of positive numbers, the task is to find the number of possible contiguous subarrays having product less than a given number k.

Example 1:

Input : 
n = 4, k = 10
a[] = {1, 2, 3, 4}
Output : 
7
Explanation:
The contiguous subarrays are {1}, {2}, {3}, {4} 
{1, 2}, {1, 2, 3} and {2, 3} whose count is 7.

4.
Run Length Encoding 
Easy Accuracy: 33.12% Submissions: 33627 Points: 2
Given a string, Your task is to  complete the function encode that returns the run length encoded string for the given string.
eg if the input string is “wwwwaaadexxxxxx”, then the function should return “w4a3d1e1x6″.
You are required to complete the function encode that takes only one argument the string which is to be encoded and returns the encoded string.

Example 1:

Input:
str = aaaabbbccc
Output: a4b3c3
Explanation: a repeated 4 times
consecutively b 3 times, c also 3
times.

5.
Ugly Numbers 
Hard Accuracy: 50.0% Submissions: 19694 Points: 8
Ugly numbers are numbers whose only prime factors are 2, 3 or 5. The sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, … shows the first 11 ugly numbers. 
By convention, 1 is included. Write a program to find Nth Ugly Number.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 10	
Output: 12
Explanation: 10th ugly number is 12.

6.
For two strings s and t, we say "t divides s" if and only if s = t + ... + t (i.e., t is concatenated with itself one or more times).

Given two strings str1 and str2, return the largest string x such that x divides both str1 and str2.

 

Example 1:

Input: str1 = "ABCABC", str2 = "ABC"
Output: "ABC"

7.
M items are to be delivered in a circle of size N. Find the position where the M-th item will be delivered if we start from a given position K. 
Note that items are distributed at adjacent positions starting from K.

 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5, M = 2, K = 1
Output:
2
Explanation:
If we start from 1st position, the
2nd item will land at the 2nd position.

8.
An encoded string (s) is given, the task is to decode it. The pattern in which the strings were encoded were as follows
original string: abbbababbbababbbab 
encoded string : 3[a3[b]1[ab]]

Example 1:

Input: s = 1[b]
Output: b
Explaination: 'b' is present only one time.

9.
Given a pattern containing only I's and D's. I for increasing and D for decreasing.
Devise an algorithm to print the minimum number following that pattern.
Digits from 1-9 and digits can't repeat.

 

Example 1:

Input:
D
Output:
21
Explanation:
D is meant for decreasing,
So we choose the minimum number
among 21,31,54,87,etc.

10.
Find max 10 numbers in a list having 10M entries.

11.
Given an unsorted array Arr of size N of positive integers. One number 'A' from set {1, 2, …N} is missing and one number 'B' occurs twice in array. Find these two numbers.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 2
Arr[] = {2, 2}
Output: 2 1
Explanation: Repeating number is 2 and 
smallest positive missing number is 1.

12.
Find total number of Squares in a N*N cheesboard.

Input:
N = 2
Output:
5
Explanation:
A 2*2 chessboard has 5 squares.
4 1*1 squares and a 2*2 square.

13.
An encoded string (s) is given, the task is to decode it. The pattern in which the strings were encoded were as follows
original string: abbbababbbababbbab 
encoded string : 3[a3[b]1[ab]]

Example 1:

Input: s = 1[b]
Output: b
Explaination: 'b' is present only one time.

14.
Given an array of positive integers nums and a positive integer target, return the minimal length of a contiguous subarray [numsl, numsl+1, ..., numsr-1, numsr] of which the sum is greater than or equal to target. If there is no such subarray, return 0 instead.

 

Example 1:

Input: target = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: The subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.

15.
Given an array of integers and a number k, write a function that returns true if given array can be divided into pairs such that sum of every pair is divisible by k.
 

Example 1 :

Input : arr = [9, 5, 7, 3], k = 6
Output: True
Explanation: {(9, 3), (5, 7)} is a 
possible solution. 9 + 3 = 12 is divisible
by 6 and 7 + 5 = 12 is also divisible by 6.
